# Synology Hetzner DDNS Script ðŸ“œ

The is a script to be used to add [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) as a DDNS to [Synology](https://www.synology.com/) NAS. The script uses the [Hetzner DNS API](https://dns.hetzner.com/api-docs/) v1.1.1.

## ToDo
- [ ] Configure zone id instead of record id and outomatically use the right record

## How to use

### Access Synology via SSH

1. Login to your DSM
2. Go to Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service
3. Use your client to access Synology via SSH.
4. Use your Synology admin account to connect.

### Run commands in Synology

1. Download `hetznerddns.sh` from this repository to `/sbin/hetznerddns.sh`

```
wget https://gitlab.com/onsive.net/SynologyHetznerDDNS/-/raw/master/hetznerddns.sh -O /sbin/hetznerddns.sh
```

It is not a must, you can put I whatever you want. If you put the script in other name or path, make sure you use the right path.

2. Give others execute permission

```
chmod +x /sbin/hetznerddns.sh
```

3. Add `hetznerddns.sh` to Synology

```
cat >> /etc.defaults/ddns_provider.conf << 'EOF'
[Hetzner]
        modulepath=/sbin/hetznerddns.sh
        queryurl=https://dns.hetzner.com/api/v1
        website=https://dns.hetzner.com
E*.
```

`queryurl` does not matter because we are going to use our script but it is needed.
